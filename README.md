## About

Written between November 2018 and January 2019 as my first foray into desktop application development using Forms. Until developing these tools, I had been hard-coding my sprite information and animation data in my projects and found the process to be very obtuse. I wished to make it more accessible for content creators to create sprite animations for use in MonoGame, so I created these tools to ease the process.

While I didn't end up using these tools much (I switched to Godot for game development soon after their completion), I learnt a lot about UI development and the data structures required to build simple 2D animations with multiple components.
